            <p>1914 translation by H.Rackham</p>"But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea
            of denouncing pleasure and praising pain was born and I will give you a complete account of
            the system,and expound the actual teachings of the great explorer of the truth, the
            master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects,dislikes,or avoids pleasure itself,because
            it is pleasure,but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter
            consequences that are extremely painful.Nor again is there anyonewho loves or pursues or desires to
            obtain pain itself, because it is pain, but because occassionally circumstances occur
            in which toil and pain can prcure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example
            , which of us ever undertakes laborius physical exercise, except to obtain
            some advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault with a man who
            chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences"

            <p class="paragraph">Machine learning, a branch of artificial intelligence, empowers computers to learn and
                improve from
                experience without being explicitly programmed. Central to its functionality is data, which provides the
                foundation for algorithms to identify patterns and make informed decisions. These algorithms leverage
                features, the measurable properties of data, to predict labels or targets in supervised learning tasks.
                Models, mathematical representations of data relationships, are trained on datasets to optimize
                parameters for accurate predictions. To assess performance, data is split into training and testing
                sets, ensuring models generalize well to new data and avoid overfitting. With supervised, unsupervised,
                and reinforcement learning techniques, machine learning finds applications in diverse fields like
                healthcare, finance, and autonomous vehicles, shaping our increasingly data-driven world.</p>

                Machine learning, a subset of artificial intelligence, enables computers to learn from data and make
                predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed. It leverages algorithms to identify
                patterns in data, which are used to train models for various tasks. With supervised, unsupervised, and
                reinforcement learning techniques, machine learning finds applications across industries,
                revolutionizing fields such as healthcare, finance, and autonomous vehicles.
